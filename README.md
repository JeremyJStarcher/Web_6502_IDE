# Web_6502_IDE

Web 6502 IDE is a learning project that got out of hand.

It features a simple editor (to be expanded upon), an embedded copy of
the DASM 6502 assembler and a 6502 emulator.

In this first release, I was after feature parity with the original
site that I took the idea from, [6502asm.com](http://6502asm.com).
