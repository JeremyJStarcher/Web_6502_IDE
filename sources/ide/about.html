			<h1>About the <i>6502 IDE</i></h1>

			<p>The 6502 IDE started off as an experiment to work with WASM and, more
				directly, the <em>emscripten</em> project.
			</p>

			<p>It was directly inspired by <a href="http://6502asm.com/">
					http://6502asm.com/</a>. My original goal was to replace the compiler
				with one more powerful as I wanted a more flexible playground to experiment
				with. I soon saw that it was very easy to replace the 6502 Emulator
				as well.
			</p>

			<h2>Meet the assembler: DASM</h2>
			<p>I choose <a href="https://dasm-assembler.github.io/">dasm</a>
				as my assembler of choice, mostly because I have worked with it on other projects and was
				quite comfortable with the tool.
			</p>

			<p>The <code>dasm</code> source is completely original
				with the sole exception of adding a <code>web_main</code>
				function that allows me to call main. I hope, with a bit more
				experience, I'll be able to get rid of <code>web_main</code>.</p>

			<p>I do use a custom makefile, mostly to set some
				<code>emscripten</code> specific things.</p>

			<h2>Meet the 6502: fake6502</h2>
			<p>
				I use the excellent <code>fake6502</code>,
				<em>(c)2011 Mike Chambers (miker00lz@gmail.com)</em>
				TThis is another package I have experience with, and it
				has a good reputation in the community. The main
				module took no modification to compile, but I did have
				to include a few helper functions.
			</p>

			<h2>The result</h2>
			<p></p>The result is the first release of <code>6502 IDE</code></p>
			<p>While the compiler is <em>slightly</em> slower than
				the origional javascript compiler, it is still very
				quick. The compiler is far more powerful than any compiler
				I have found on a web-based 6502 emulator.</p>
			<p>The origional JavaScript emulator is extremely slow and is
				heavily affected by the speed of the computer. This made most
				of the demos run at an OK speed, but some of the games may have been
				too fast.</p>
			<p>The new emulator runs somewhere around 100x faster. As
				a result, the <code>6502 IDE</code> allows you to set a
				processor speed used for the emulation.
