This directory contains files & instructions to create a 'dasm build machine' 
Docker image that can build platform-specific dasm binaries for all three 
supported OSs (Linux, Windows and macOS) in a single go!

Steps to create the Docker image:

0. Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your machine
1. Open a command prompt (Windows) or a bash shell (Linux/macOS) into this  
   folder (i.e. containing the Dockerfile)
2. Run the command: `docker build -t dasm:build .`  
   Note: this will download/install all build tools so takes a while.

Steps to run the Docker container and build dasm for all 3 platforms:

1. Now run the container: `docker run -it --rm dasm:build`, which opens a shell
   to the container.
   Note: unless you want fetch a clone the dasm git repo and build that, it is
   probably easier to mount a shared drive in your docker container.
   On Windows, you can mount your c: drive on /mnt/c by running
   `docker run -it --rm -v c:\:/mnt/c dasm:build` (*)
   (*) This requires drive-sharing enabled in Docker Desktop, and sometimes
   needs this powershell command to allow that:
   `Set-NetConnectionProfile -interfacealias "vEthernet (DockerNAT)" -NetworkCategory Private`
2. From the container shell, cd into a shared drive that contains a local git  
   clone of the dasm repo. Or do a 'git clone' on the container itself, e.g.  
   `git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm.git`
3. cd into the dasm/docker folder from within the container shell
4. Run: `./make_dasm_all_platforms.sh`
5. This will sequentally call 'make' for all target platforms and copies the  
   different dasm binaries into the /bin directory.
