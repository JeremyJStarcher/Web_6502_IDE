Executables provided for Mac OS X and Windows.

Usage:
    pretty6502 [args] input.asm output.asm

It's recommended to not use same output file as input,
even if possible because there is a chance (0.0000001%)
that you can DAMAGE YOUR SOURCE if Pretty6502 has
undiscovered bugs.

Arguments:
    -s0       Code in four columns (default)
              label: mnemonic operand comment
    -s1       Code in three columns
              label: mnemonic+operand comment

    -p0       Processor unknown.
    -p1       Processor 6502 + DASM syntax (default)
    -p2       Processor Z80 + tniASM syntax
    -p3       Processor CP1610 + as1600 syntax (Intellivision)
    -p4       Processor TMS9900 + xas99 syntax (TI-99/4A)

    -m8       Start of mnemonic column (default)
    -o16      Start of operand column (default)
    -c32      Start of comment column (default)

    -a0       Align comments to nearest column
    -a1       Comments at line start are aligned
              to mnemonic (default)

    -n4       Nesting spacing (can be any number
              of spaces or multiple of tab size)

    -l        Put labels in its own line

    -dl       Change directives to lowercase
    -du       Change directives to uppercase
